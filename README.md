# PyMeow
The simple way to get cats 🐱
## About

This is a simple python wrapper for using API of https://thecatapi.com/.
By this module you can get images of cats🐱 or information of their breeds.
You can see examples in the [examples folder](https://github.com/funnyruler/pymeow/tree/main/examples).
All entities are represented as pydantic models.
API have more than 60k images, breeds and facts about cats.
I recommend to [sign up](https://thecatapi.com/#pricing) and get API key, its free and this removes most of the restrictions and limits.



## Development
`pymeow` is being actively developed, and new API changes should arrive on `pymeow` very quickly. `pymeow` uses `requests` and `dataclasses` as models for its methods.
In the future, I will add `async` version of this wrapper.


## Installation
[PyPi page](https://pypi.org/project/PyMeow/)
`pymeow` requires python 3.9 or higher. This module can be installed by pip:
```
pip install pymeow
```

## Usage
```python
from pymeow import Client


client = Client(api_key='your_api_key')
random_cat = client.get_cat(has_breeds=True)  # get random cat with breads(requires api key)

print(random_cat)
